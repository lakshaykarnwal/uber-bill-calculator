# Bill Calculator

## Overview

Bill Calculator is a simple desktop application built using Python and PyQt5 to help you split bills among friends. If you often order food together using a shared account, such as a premium Uber account, this app will allow you to quickly and accurately divide the total cost according to each friend's order. The app ensures that everyone benefits from shared discounts, tax, service charges, and delivery fees, making it easier to manage group expenses.

## Features

- **Dynamic Entry Fields**: Enter the number of friends, and the app will dynamically generate input fields for each friend's meal cost.
- **Cost Calculation**: Automatically calculates the amount each friend owes, considering the meal cost, service charges, taxes, discounts, and delivery fees.
- **Stylish Interface**: A modern and dark-themed interface with custom-styled buttons and input fields.
